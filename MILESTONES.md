# Mochi milestones

Archived versions of Mochi, so earlier looks can always be restored (Eagle is
attached to her appearance, and a personal "Lettuce" version may come from one
of these). Each is a commit in this repository; `git checkout <commit> -- dist`
brings that version's app back.

| Milestone | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OG Mochi | `135be78` | The first realistic ragdoll: the Meshy model, rigged at load time, with fur and real eyes. |
| Live build 84 | `10e1fc6` | The living room only, before the kitchen. |
| Live build 108 | `a82c556` | The kitchen, as Lettuce first enjoyed it. |
| Live build 136 | `670a3b9` | The new rig and movement (gallop, real steps), the study and kitchen joined by a doorway, night with a sun/moon button and a night-owl cat, kitchen Halloween and Thanksgiving, the lamp ride, Orion's cushions. (`?motion=classic` still brings back the old movement.) |
| Live build 137 | `631f8ab` | Mouth reaches the food and water (sits in the sink to lap the faucet), monarch butterflies at the windows, vacuum steers round the island and stools, steadier legs on turns and shelves, gathered tent flaps. |
| Live build 171 | `70ade23` | Walks like a cat (set to measured cat numbers: longer slower steps, lower, narrow track, no stutter-step), a trot for every run, gallop only at a dash or zoomies, hind legs no longer hop together. |
| Live build 174 | `97f11c8` | Halloween stored away out of October (a room left in it wakes up as Thanksgiving). |
| Live build 267 | `1aba265` | Looking around and touching her: one finger drags the room like a map and circles her up close, two fingers pinch, turn and tilt, double tap looks closer, a floor tap calls her; she reacts to where she's touched (chin loved, tail and paws not, belly a trap until friends). |
| Live build 284 | `0c2ec70` | The panel under the room redesigned (layout A): the need that wants her most is a big card with its button, the rest fill like glasses; glossy icons made with Meshy and Runway; a pink friendship card; moments grouped by day. Also carries the other session's camera and film-note commits up to `0c2ec70`. |
| Live build 294 | `cdd41b3` | The dock over the room uses the glossy icons (bowl, yarn, heart, brush; a moon for Rest that becomes a sun for Wake). Also carries the other session's camera commit (pinching in on her from a view of your own) and test-only changes. |
| Live build 323 | `72e3372` | Camera that's easy to aim: a pinch zooms towards the spot between the fingers (on her: to her), never into a wall; the view tilts down to her level as it comes closer; turning stops before the camera backs into a wall; on a phone, leaving the whole-room view no longer jumps and dragging stops at the room's edge. Also carries the other session's opening film after Enter, first steps and the phone's pull-up panel. |
| Motion trial, first review | `6dbfb4d` | Repaired rig and authored walk, sit and lie-down (trial page only). |
| Live build 323, same build | `72e3372` | 2026-11-13. Also in it: the opening film "Mochi and the yarn ball" after Enter (day, plain study, upright screen), first steps for new players (tap the ball, a stroke), and the phone layout with the pull-up panel (phase 08). Before it: `cdd41b3`. |
| Live build 330 | `8624a88` | 2026-11-13. The opening film plays at night too (Merlin: evening players never saw it); the sunny film then fades into the night room. Before it: `72e3372`. |
| Live build 333 | `f16091b` | 2026-11-13. The opening film in its long cut, 13.5 s (Merlin: 9.8 s was too short): the same four shots at nearly full length. Also a link can open straight into a look and a room (other session). Before it: `8624a88`. |
| Live build 339 | `7beff45` | 2026-11-13. Fixes on top of build 333 (main plus five picked commits, not the whole preview branch): the title screen's glow keeps its size on a slow phone and is drawn without smoothed edges on phones (an iPhone showed the title as a black screen with a strip of picture; not confirmed fixed on Merlin's phone yet; `?fx=0` shows the title with no effects); the page fetches fresh files when a new build is out, then loads once more; the Christmas look is offered in the picker from November. Not included: the two camera modes and the 20 s opening film, still on the preview. |
| Live build 345 | `8fb63a4` | 2026-11-13. Two camera modes, Explore and Mochi (phase 16; Merlin's "Go live", camera only: main plus the six camera commits, the 20 s film stays on the preview). One finger turns, pinch and double tap aim at things, the mode changes only on the buttons, a wide turn from side wall to side wall. Before it: `7beff45`. |
| Live build 392 | `b2b4f1c` | 2026-11-14. Merlin's "Go live" for the whole preview (fork only, jvtomax99.github.io/Cat-app/): the opening film in its combined 20 s cut on every launch; reasons to come back, gifts, toy basket and photo button (phase 17); friendship over days, a wish a day, later gifts (17b); smaller cat file, offline copy (18); the three camera fixes. Phases 17, 17b, 18 and the camera fixes went live without a try on a real phone. Before it: `8fb63a4`. |
| Live build 396 | `d1dfb5d` | 2026-11-14. Music the player can pick (Music box, Piano, Guitar; made with ElevenLabs) in the sound panel, off unless picked, with its own volume (Merlin's "Go live"). Also the privacy page and the App Store list. Not checked on a real phone. Before it: `b2b4f1c`. |
| Live build 400 | `0fc368d` | 2026-11-14. Merlin's "Go live" (fork only). An app left open picks up a new build by itself: it looks again on coming back to the front and every half hour, fetches the build behind the app, and switches on the next return, in one load without the title. Not tried on a real phone, the iPhone home-screen icon above all. Before it: `d1dfb5d`. |

Direction (Merlin and Orion): preserve her identity, not her imperfections.
Her face, expressions, proportions, rig and movement may keep improving;
the original geometry isn't untouchable, but she stays recognisably the same
peculiar, endearing kitten. Paid Meshy is reserved for a second cat.
