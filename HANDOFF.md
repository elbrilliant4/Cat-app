# Handoff: 2026-11-12

## State
- Live: build 174 = `97f11c8` (walk and trot, Halloween away); `main` has
  since had docs and rules added (`43fdbf8`).
- Preview branch `claude/expressive-cat-modern-ui-65z6r5`: on 2026-11-12
  `main` was merged into it (Merlin's choice), so it now holds both lines
  of work: vacuum Vision (phase 02), the title screen and zoomies cinematic
  (11, 11b), move like a real cat (12), and the new **Christmas kitchen
  (phase 13)**. None of it is live; all of it waits on Merlin.
- Christmas kitchen: built in code from Orion's day and night pictures, no
  bought assets, no Meshy or Runway credits used. Shows in December, or now
  with `?decor=christmas` on the address, then the look picker. Stills:
  `DECOR=christmas node tools/qa/look.mjs`.

## Next (ask Merlin which)
1. Merlin looks at the Christmas kitchen on the preview and gives notes
   or "Go live" (go live takes the whole preview branch: check with him
   that phases 11, 11b and 12 are ready to go with it, or go live with
   less).
2. Phase 12, move like a real cat (`docs/phases/12-cat-motion.md`): paused
   by Merlin 2026-11-12, he is working on a new cat model. Ask before going
   on. The swat's third take still needs its clip
   (`SCENE=swat FPS=30 SEC=3.8 node tools/qa/clip.mjs`).
3. Phase 11b leftovers: music sting, paw-wipe, logo polish.
4. Phase 03, the study's `tailSolids` and `tools/qa/tail.mjs`.
5. Christmas for the study and the tree (phase 06), Miso, phases 08, 09.

## Gotchas
- After the merge, `tools/qa/vacuum.mjs` and `legs.mjs` have not been
  rerun on the joined code (phase 12 changed the motion, phase 02 the
  kitchen floor): run both before anything goes live.
- QA stills: the look picker redresses the room 120 ms after the tap, on
  real time; wait before stepping (see `look.mjs`).
- Merlin judges by eye and ear: send pictures, clips and sound files.
- The older notes still hold: background runs with `run_in_background`,
  one render at a time (two at once time out), software 3D is slow.
