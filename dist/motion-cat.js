// The new movement in the app: drives the repaired rig (rig v2) with the
// motion trial's approach, behind the same cat.update(dt, t, ctl) the app
// already calls, so the app's behaviour code doesn't change.
//
//  - Body poses (stand, sit, loaf, sleep, crouch, stretch, beg, belly, leap)
//    are targets for the pelvis, spine, chest, shoulder blades, head and
//    tail. Changing pose, each part moves on its own timing: settling down,
//    the hips lead and the chest follows; getting up, the chest leads.
//  - Paws are planted in the world. Walking is the four-beat walk, its
//    stride and rhythm following how fast she's actually moving; each paw
//    lands where the leg will be upright mid-stance. Standing, turning or
//    changing pose, a paw that's far from where that pose wants it takes a
//    small step there, one at a time (her shuffles back to sit, forward to
//    lie down). In the air the paws reach and tuck; riding the vacuum they
//    stay planted on it.
//  - Her support surface (floor, shelf, counter, sink, vacuum) is always the
//    height she's standing at: the body, paws and tail rest on it with the
//    soft contact (switched off mid-jump).
