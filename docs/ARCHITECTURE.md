# Architecture

Plain ES modules in `dist/`, three.js vendored in `dist/vendor/`. No build
step. `npm run dev` serves on :5173. `npm run check` = syntax + care checks.
Publishing: `.github/workflows/pages.yml` deploys `main` at the root and the
preview branch (`PREVIEW_BRANCH` in that file) at `/preview/`, plus a review
pack (`tools/review-pack/`). `preview.yml` re-runs it on every push to the
preview branch.

## Files
| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `app.js` | The brain: state (`brain`, `pet`), behaviours, walking and jumping, camera, night, rooms, debug hooks. Big file; search by function name. |
| `motion-cat.js` | `MotionCat`: poses (`POSES`), walk (to 1.0), trot (1.0-2.2) and gallop gaits, foot placement and stepping, eating reach. Walk numbers from real cats: `docs/phases/07-walk-grace.md`. |
| `motion.js` | `MotionRig`: IK legs (`solveLeg`, `reachShort` = how far a leg is short of its paw), spine, head and neck, tail (`drapeTail`, bed bounds), floor contact. |
| `cat-rig.js` | Builds the skeleton and skin weights from the Meshy model at load. |
| `real-cat.js` | Fur, eyes, face, ears, jaw; also the classic movement (`?motion=classic`). |
| `room.js` | `Room`: the study, bowl, fountain, window visitors (bird, moths, monarch). Shared methods live on `Room.prototype` (the kitchen uses them too). |
| `kitchen.js` | `Kitchen`: island, shelves, sink and faucet, pendant lamp, robot vacuum, terrace, dog (`?dog`). Layout constants in `K`; spots in `layout()`. |
| `decor.js` | Seasonal decor for both rooms; `pillowGeometry`. Seasonal looks have `months` and are stored away out of season (`inSeason`, `decorNow`; `?decor=halloween` shows one anyway). |
| `pet-state.js`, `save.js` | Care meters, saves, offline progress. |
| `sound.js`, `meows.js` | Short sounds and meows (no ambient loops). |

## Frame loop (app.js)
`frame(now)` → `updateCat(dt, t)` → `updateCamera(dt)` → `updateRoom(dt, t)` → render.

`updateCat` order: idle and night choices (`idleLife`, `nightLife`) →
movement toward `brain.target` (heading, turn caps) → eyes, head, gaze →
eating reach → pick a pose → `cat.update(dt, t, ctl)` (MotionCat).

## Behaviour model
- `brain.mode` (idle, feed, drink, play, brush, …) and `brain.activity`
  (walk, sit, eat, jump, …), set with `setActivity(name, seconds, then)`.
- Moving: `walkTo(point, then, run, anywhere)`, `jumpTo(perchName)`,
  `leap(...)`, `jumpDown`. Perches are listed in `PERCHES` (per room).
- Player actions go through `act('feed' | 'drink' | 'play' | …)`.

## Coordinates and sizes
- The active room is at the origin; `brain.pos` is in its frame. The other
  room is placed by `JOIN` (seen through the doorway; `cullThroughDoor`
  hides what's out of view).
- Her own frame: +z is forward. The root is near the front legs: front
  wrists at z +.23, hips at -.48, tail base at -.71. Standing nose about
  +.4 ahead; head down to eat, her mouth reaches about +.75 to +.9.
- Mouth point: `cat.bones.jaw.localToWorld(new V(0, -.015, .14))`.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)
- **Study walks are clamped to the rug** (`onRug`) unless `walkTo(..., anywhere = true)`.
- The kitchen vacuum avoids the island with `route(from, to, pad)`
  (pad .45, .7 with her riding); `clampVacuum` keeps it out of the padded
  box, `clampVacBox` inside `VAC_FLOOR` / `VAC_FLOOR_RIDE` (its body, and
  her head and hips aboard, clear of the walls and counter). A route it
  can't find returns `[]` and it picks another goal (never a straight line
  through the furniture). By the window the lane is just wide enough for
  it with her aboard: KEEP_OUT, the riding pad and `VAC_FLOOR_RIDE.x0` are
  tuned together (padded island edge -5.25, box -5.3); move one, re-check
  the others or the left-side corner nodes vanish and no route exists.
- `KEEP_OUT` (her centre) is .65 from the island's faces and 1.35 in
  front of it: her head and hips reach about .6 from her centre, the stool
  legs .7 in front of the island. Shrink it and she walks through the stools.
  `FLOOR` is .6 from the counter and the window wall for the same reason.
  `clampFloor` and `pushOut` run the island's margin and the circles a few
  times and end with the margin (squeezed between it and the vacuum's
  circle, the margin wins), `clampFloor` then the floor's edge.
- The gap at the foot of the wall steps (between the counter's end and the
  window wall) is .78 wide and she is 1.2 long: routes go in and out by
  `GAP_MOUTH`, and at the foot she keeps facing north or the first step
  (`atStepFoot` in app.js). Any turn across the gap puts her in the wall.
- Boarding or stalking the vacuum, `approachVacuum` picks a side where she
  and her landing stay on free floor; off it, `PERCHES.vacuum.base` scores
  both sides, ahead and behind. `randomFloorPoint(pad)` keeps the vacuum's
  goals outside each obstacle's padded circle: `route()` drops a circle
  that holds the goal, and would drive straight through it.
- **Her tail keeps out of furniture** in `MotionRig.clearTail(solids)`
  (`motion.js`), run after the tail is posed and laid on the floor: each
  joint inside a solid turns its bone to bring it out by the nearest face
  (lying on top counts as out). The solids come per frame from
  `tailSolids()` in `app.js`: the room layout's `tailSolids` list (the
  kitchen's is in `layout()`, the study's in `studyTailSolids()`) minus her bed while
  she's in it and the counter while she sits in the sink, plus the vacuum
  where it is, and the study's mantel vase while it stands. Shapes: `box`,
  `cyl`, `rbox` (turned box, the tent, the armchair); `climb: true` on a
  low `cyl` (her bed's rim) lifts a trailing tail over it instead of
  shoving it sideways. Walls are 3 m deep on purpose: a tail swung right
  through a thin one would be past it and never pushed back. Her bed
  counts as "in it" over its cushion, or up off the floor near it.
- The motion rig resets the jaw and ears each frame (otherwise rotations pile up).
- Random choices make runs differ: seed `Math.random` (QA `open({seed})`).
  `setTimeout` and `performance.now` are real time: in QA they're put on
  virtual time (`lib.mjs`), else a busy machine changes the run.
- `MotionCat` paws: a standing (corrective) swing and a walking (`gait`)
  swing are advanced by different code; a swing of the wrong kind for the
  current mode is never finished (that was the dragged leg).
- Software WebGL is slow: step with `kitten.step(dt, n, false)` (draws only the last frame).
- github.io is blocked from the cloud container; check the deploy workflow run instead.
- Night: `clockNight()` (sunset table) or `?night=0` / `?night=1`.
